AtliQ Hardware, a rapidly growing consumer electronics company, faced limitations with Excel files, causing setbacks in the Latin American market. Our mission was clear: empower AtliQ Hardware with advanced analytics for efficient data analysis and smarter decision-making.

 Below are actionable insights and recommendations from this project.

1. Despite a rising trend, AtliQ’s net sales is still below the 2022 target.
Recommendation - Launch targeted marketing campaigns to raise product awareness and attract new consumers. Offer discounts on top-selling, high-margin products to encourage bigger purchases and increase revenue.

2. Amazon is AtliQ's top revenue-generating customer, but it's falling short of the gross margin (GM%) and net profit (NP%) targets.
Recommendation - To improve GM% and NP%, AtliQ’s should focus on reducing pre or post-invoice deductions for Amazon while also working to lower operational expenses related to servicing Amazon.

3. AtliQ Exclusive is excelling in both revenue contribution % and gross margin (GM%).
Recommendation - Capitalize on this success by offering more discounts and boosting revenue through AtliQ's own store.

4. AtliQ's market share % in the PC market has shown significant growth over the years.
Recommendation - By intensifying promotion efforts within the PC division, AtliQ has the opportunity to secure the position of the third largest market share in PCs.
